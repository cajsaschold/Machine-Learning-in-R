# Machine Learning Course - TDDE01

Welcome to the repository for the course `TDDE01 - Machine Learning`. This repository includes labs covering various topics in machine learning. Below is an overview of the labs and their assignments:

## Lab 1

### Assignment 2: Linear regression and ridge regression
Predicting Parkinson's disease symptom scores (motor UPDRS) using linear regression and ridge regression. Key tasks include data preprocessing, building linear and ridge regression models, optimizing parameters, and evaluating model performance through mean squared error (MSE) for training and test data.

## Lab 2

### Assignment 3: Principal components and implicit regularization
Analyzing principal components and implicit regularization in the context of crime level. Key tasks include scaling variables, implementing PCA using the eigen() and princomp() functions, analyzing trace plot, identifying features contributing significantly etc. as well as estimating a linear regression model where the results are evaluated focused on identifying the optimal iteration number based on the early stopping criterion.

## Lab 3

### Assignment 1: Kernel Methods
Using kernel methods for making temperature prediction in Sweden by implementing three Gaussian kernels based on physical distance, day-to-day distance, and hour-to-hour distance. Manually analyzing and determine the appropriate smoothing and investigating the differences in the predictions when summing and multiplying the kernels together.
